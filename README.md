### Applying the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) in the Programming 2 class at the Technological Institute of the Americas (ITLA).

### Project Description

#### Welcome to my project for practicing object-oriented design principles. Here, I'm exploring and applying the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) through practical exercises with an application that manages course information.

### Exercise 1: Initial Implementation
Its purpose was to design a class hierarchy for online and onsite courses that adhere to the LSP, ensuring derived instances can substitute the base class without issues.

### Exercise 2: Adding New Classes
Its purpose was to expand the hierarchy to include hybrid courses, verifying that this new class also complies with the LSP. This ensures that all course classes work interchangeably, promoting flexible and maintainable software design.

### Thank you for your attention!
